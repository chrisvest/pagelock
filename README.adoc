= PageLock

Have you ever felt like your computer just has _too much_ RAM?
No more! PageLock will take all that excess RAM and make it go away!

This is useful for quickly testing software in memory constrained environments.
It's not quite the same as starting up a virtual machine with a small memory allocation.
The `pagelock` program will simply use however much memory you tell it to, but all the overhead of managing that memory is still there.
